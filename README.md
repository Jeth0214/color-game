# Color Guessing Game

### This is a javaScript rgb color application where in the challenge is to pick which
### one of the six random circle colors is the rgb color listed at the top of the page.

There are three channels red, green, and blue and each one ranges from 0 to 255 and all.

R = red = rgb(255, 0, 0)
g = green = rgb(0, 255, 0)
b = blue = rgb(0, 0, 255)

We need are those three colors to make every single color that we could ever want.
Black white yellow orange purple all of those are actually made by combining red green and blue.
So we have red green and blue and to make yellow rgb(255, 255, 0).
We actually combine red and green which is maybe a
little different than what you're expected to make magenta rgb(255, 0, 255).
And to make Cyan is light blue color it's green and blue rgb(0, 255, 255).
And then lastly to make white we combine all three rgb(255, 255, 255).
So this is great application  to get some practice and to remind us how RGV works.
